# What Is an Online Browser?

An online browser is a web browser that runs on another computer in the cloud, not on your own device. You control it from your screen, and it lets you surf the internet safely and easily.

# How Does an Online Browser Work?

It works by running a real browser on a remote server and streaming it to you like a video. You click and type like normal, but nothing actually happens on your device. It all happens in the cloud.

# What Are Online Browser Use Cases?

## Safely Test Suspicious Links

You can use an online browser to safely test links without risking your real system. For example, you can open unknown links in emails or weird websites.

## Browse in a Sandboxed Environment

A sandboxed browser runs in the cloud, so nothing touches your files, settings, or network.

## Cross-Browser Testing Made Easy

Quickly check how your site looks and works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and other browsers without installing anything.

## Avoid Malware on Sketchy Sites

Online browsers keep dangerous code away from your computer when visiting risky or outdated websites.

## Access Developer Tools on Clean Browsers

Test or debug websites in clean browsers with no extensions, plugins, or cache to mess things up.

## Test Browsers Without Breaking Your Setup

Try old or new browser versions for testing without changing anything on your real machine.

##  Run Isolated Sessions for Privacy

Each time you open the browser, it's a fresh and private session. No saved history, no tracking.
